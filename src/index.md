            Since 2010, the <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Hardware Association</a>, a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity, has hosted the <strong>Open Hardware Summit</strong>- a comprehensive conference for the open hardware community and the ever changing open source hardware movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speakers include world renowned leaders from industry, academia, the arts and maker community. Talks cover a wide range of subjects from electronics, mechanics to related fields such as digital fabrication, fashion technology, self-quantification devices, and IP law. As a microcosm of the Open Source Hardware community, the Open Hardware Summit provides an annual, friendly forum for the community.
