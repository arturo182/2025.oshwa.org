            Since 2010, the <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Hardware Association</a>, a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity, has hosted the <strong>Open Hardware Summit</strong>- a comprehensive conference for the open hardware community and the ever changing open source hardware movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speakers include world renowned leaders from industry, academia, the arts and maker community. Talks cover a wide range of subjects from electronics, mechanics to related fields such as digital fabrication, fashion technology, self-quantification devices, and IP law. As a microcosm of the Open Source Hardware community, the Open Hardware Summit provides an annual, friendly forum for the community.

- People who can help us reach the weird, wonderful, and technical open source, Hacker, DIY, tech/art and maker community in **Edinburgh**, **Glasgow**, and all around the UK and Europe.

- People who are excited about reaching diverse and underrepresented populations.
- Spaces interesting in hosting workshops, parties, community gatherings and other happenings.

Specifically, we are still looking for a **venue for day 2**, which can hold people in various rooms for breakout sessions and workshops.

We do not require that all presentations, organizers, or helpers be open source certified or contribute to open source projects, but only that you are enthusiastic about sharing and learning about open source work.

Here's what you'll get:

- Connected with some of the world's most active open source communities. Past sponsors have included Sparkfun, Arduino, Digikey, and other key players in the hardware community.
- A free or discounted ticket to the event.
- Free opportunity to exhibit your work to over 300 people.
- A hand in forming the vision for one of the largest Open Source events in 2025.
- An unforgettable experience with cool people from around the world!
- An opportunity to connect globally with people working in your field- be it academically, recreationally, or within the industry.
